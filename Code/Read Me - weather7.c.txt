weather7.c read me…

I've been "playing around" with the weather station display adding addtional graphics such as: a thermometer graphic that shows the current temperature relative to the average annual high and low temperature, a windsock graphic to give an accurate indication of the winspeed, a compass graphic to give a visual indication of the wind direction, a sun graphic to give a visual indication of the current brightness and that at night displays the Moon with the correct Moon phase.

I’m probably going to leave it alone at this point and move on to another project, but I've said that before...

Enjoy!
